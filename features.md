**Rules:**
**Keep the rules brief to avoid anyone purposefully try to break them**
* Safezones/ Safetimes:
    * Any WCS school grounds (Indy, Summit, Ravenwood, etc.) are safe zones.   
    * In a moving vehicle.
        * If you are in a moving vehicle with your target, you cannot eliminate them if the car is in motion.  This is to mitigate any issues of people jumping from moving vehicles to avoid elimination.  
        * If you are in a moving vehicle but your target is not (ie. outside) or vice versa (target is in a vehicle with windows down), that is fair game. 
    * Jobs
        * Attempting an elimination at a target's work while they are working will result in an elimination.
* Conflicts on eliminations:
    * Should there be any conflicts in elimination (Someone falsely claming an elimination), there will be a duel to decide who is legitimately eliminated.  
* Safety
    * If something happens that is tied to the game that infringes on players' safety but is not explicitly stated in the rules, game management will have jurisdiction over the event.  

**Teams**
* After 75% of players have been eliminated, the teams will be divded into duos 
* After 50% of players have been eliminated in duos, the game will switch to free for all.
* Once we reach the final 2 players, a duel will take place on an agreed upon time at a park where everyone who played in the class of 2023 will be invited to watch and cheer.
    * Winner will be handed the money after the duel by Gamemasters
* Zombie Squads
    * Larger sized groups are released during Spring Break consisting of previously eliminated players
    * Zombie Squads will be disbanded and zombies will be eliminated once the game switches to free for all
